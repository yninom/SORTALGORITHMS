    "\n",
    "Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that requires operations $O(n^{2})$ to sort a list of n elements. It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for the smallest item in the list\n",
    "- Exchange it with the first one\n",
    "- Find the next lowest item in the rest of the list\n",
    "- Swap it with the second one\n",
    "\n",
    "And in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for the minimum element between a position i and the end of the list.\n",
    "- Exchange the minimum with the element of the position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest selection method is perhaps the following:\n",
    "- Find the smallest key; transfer the corresponding record to the output area;\n",
    "then replace the key by the value ∞ (which is assumed to be higher than\n",
    "any actual key).\n",
    "- Repeat step one. This time the second smallest key will be selected, since\n",
    "the smallest key has been replaced by $\\infty$.\n",
    "- Continue repeating step one until N records have been selected.\n",

    "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are playing a card game. You have the cards in your hand and the cards are sorted. You take exactly one new card from the deck. You have to place it in the right place so that the cards in your hand are still sorted. In sorting by selection, each element you add to the sorted subarray is greater than or equal to the elements already in the sorted subarray. But in our example of the cards, the new card might be less than some of the cards you already have in your hand, so you go one by one, comparing the new card with each of the cards you already have in your hand, until you find the place where it should be placed. You insert the new card in the correct place and, once again, you have completely sorted cards in your hand. Then you take another card from the deck and repeat the same procedure. Then another card, and another, and so on, until you finish with the deck.\n",
